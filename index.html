                <p>This project was started around September of 2016. A project started out of curiosity, the main focus was to simply see 24 hour time in hexadecimal instead of decimal. 
				I consider it noteworthy since it is the first project where I worked with timers and time formatting. In addition, this project has great potential for expandability. 
				For example, one plan is to develop a mobile application that makes use of it. </p>

                You're staring at it right now. This website was started as another source of information about myself for employers. It is the central hub for various other website that I am a part of such as LinkedIn and Github. 
				
				In addition, this website was a chance for me to relearn HTML and improve my skills at designing from scratch. This was my first website trying W3-CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Overall, I am proud of this website and will likely continue to update it as life progresses and as new projects are worked on.

            </header>
            <p class="w3-large">My name is Bradley Sawyer Johnson. I was born and raised around Montgomery, Alabama. I first started using computers when I was young with small educational games. I became more familiar with using computers through technology classes and clubs during elementary and middle school. These gave me skills using common work applications such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in my classes and basic programming through clubs. In high school, I took my first computer science course introducing me to the occupation. After learning HTML, Java, and core computer science concepts, I was convinced of my future in computer science. 
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville seeking a bachelor's degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in mathematics. One of my biggest interests right now is machine learning and its capabilities especially when applied to cybersecurity. Computer science has given me an understanding and fondness for problem-solving. It is always incredibly satisfying when a difficult, sanity-draining issue is resolved. Currently, I am searching for opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills I've gained into larger-scale projects while expanding my knowledge and skills.
